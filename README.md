# German Concertina Notes
This project is to help learning the German Concertina (C/G), inspired by the windows application of [konzertinanetz.de](https://www.konzertinanetz.de).

## Motivation
Since I play the German Concertina myself I discovered the above described tool. The tool was developed for Windows and is not executable on my Mac. So I decided to rebuild it with simple web technologies.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to use
Both sides of the C/G-Concertina are displayed (first row = push, second row = pull). You can choose a note from the selection below the concertina or by typing the corresponding letter on the keyboard. This will highlight the different positions of the note on the concertina.

To choose a F# from the keyboard you can enter the #. To remove all selected notes you can use the ESC button on your keyboard.

**Please note:** In german music theory the notes are A **H** C D E F G. So you might find explanations for the german concertina using an H instead of B.

### Building chords
In order to find the positions for possible chords, you can drag the root to the position of the desired root note. To form the triad you will have to play the root note, the third and fifth note.
You may discover that it is not always possible to form the triad.

**Note:** m3 = Minor 3rd, M3 = Major 3rd
