# German Concertina Notes
This project is to help learning the German Concertina (C/G), inspired by the windows application of (konzertinanetz.de)[https://www.konzertinanetz.de].

## Motivation
Since I play the German Concertina myself I discovered the above described tool. The tool was developed for Windows and is not executable on my Mac. So I decided to rebuild it with simple web technologies.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to use
Both sides of the C/G-Concertina are displayed (first row = push, second row = pull). You can choose a note from the selection below the concertina or by typing the corresponding letter on the keyboard. This will highlight the different positions of the note on the concertina.

To choose a F# from the keyboard you can enter the #. To remove all selected notes you can use the ESC button on your keyboard.

**Please note:** In german music theory the notes are A **H** C D E F G. So you might find explanations for the german concertina using an H instead of B.

## Planned features
I will add the chord builder from the Windows tool, so that it is possible to easily find the positions to build a chord (Major, Minor, Deminished) by choosing the base note.
